## Tutorial 1: Serialization
### Introduction
This tutorial will cover creating a simple pastebin code highlighting Web API. 
Along the way it will introduce the various components that make up REST framework, 
and give you a comprehensive understanding of how everything fits together.

The tutorial is fairly in-depth, so you should probably get a cookie and a cup of your favorite brew before getting started. 
If you just want a quick overview, you should head over to the quickstart documentation instead.
